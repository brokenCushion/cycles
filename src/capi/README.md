# Cycles C API — Phase 1

Experimental shared-library boundary for host applications such as Gaffer.
The contract is [cycles_c.h](cycles_c.h): it contains no Cycles C++ headers or
deep types. Phase 1 initializes resource paths, enumerates native devices,
reports compiled capabilities and routes logs. It does **not** render yet.

## Build and test

Use the repository's [build prerequisites](../../BUILDING.md), including its
supported compiler and dependency bundle. Configure a **fresh build directory**
and set the install prefix at configure time:

```text
cmake -S . -B <build> -DWITH_CYCLES_C_API=ON -DBUILD_TESTING=ON -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<new-install>
cmake --build <build> --target cycles_c cycles_c_host cycles_c_contract
ctest --test-dir <build> -R "^cycles_c_" --output-on-failure
```

On Windows, run these in the configured clang-cl/Visual Studio environment.
Runtime dependencies must be discoverable by the OS loader (the dependency
bundle's DLL directories on PATH for build-tree tests). The existing dependency
installation helper also supplies them for installed builds. Inspect generated
install destinations before installing; never reuse a qualified install prefix.
Keep build directories and test output outside the repository, on D: locally.
Before a full `cmake --install <build>`, build the default target too; the native
install rules also need resources such as compiled OSL shaders, not just the DLL.
For a build without the unrelated USD/Hydra integration, set both
`WITH_CYCLES_USD=OFF` and `WITH_CYCLES_HYDRA_RENDER_DELEGATE=OFF`.

`cycles_c_host <absolute-library-path> <absolute-resource-path> <absolute-user-path>`
is compiled as C11, uses LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress or dlopen/dlsym, and has no
Cycles import-library dependency. `cycles_c_contract` additionally checks native
enumeration, exception containment, struct sizes, thread-local errors and logging.
`cycles_c_exports` requires the exact seven public functions, rejecting extra
symbols even if they start with `ccl_`. No tests depend on deep being enabled.

## Phase 1 outline decisions

- Version, feature and device-count queries return `ccl_status` and write into
  host-owned outputs. An error cannot masquerade as zero devices or an unsupported
  feature. Version output also has a size field instead of returning an extensible
  struct by value. All public integers have explicit widths.
- Init exposes the **two existing native resource roots**, not independent kernel,
  OSL and temporary paths that native `path_init` does not provide. Repeated init
  with identical strings is allowed; changing roots is rejected.
- Device metadata is an immutable discovery snapshot. Its strings live for the
  library's process lifetime. Compiled backend support is distinct from available
  hardware. OSL denotes compiled support; individual devices report their support.
- The deep capability stays false until the C API extension is implemented, even
  if the underlying Cycles build includes deep code.
- Log callbacks are serialized, may run on worker threads, and cannot reenter the
  API. Removing/replacing a callback waits for the old call to finish. Callback
  strings are borrowed only during that call. Native severity filtering is kept.
- Phase 1 supports one loaded Cycles library retained until process exit. Safe
  unload, multiple simultaneous versions, resource relocation and backend runtime
  compatibility need explicit lifecycle design before the Phase 7 swap promise.

Before extending section 4: use the same status/out convention for fallible
reflection and handle creation; specify scene/graph ownership and deletion
invalidation; do not assume pausing rendering alone makes scene edits safe;
define callback lifetime, cancellation and buffer stride/capacity rules before
session/output functions. These are proposals, not implemented future phases.

## Internal changes

No Cycles rendering, device, scene, scheduling or kernel source was changed.
Build integration adds an opt-in `WITH_CYCLES_C_API` and shared wrapper target,
and enables position-independent static objects when that option is on. The
wrapper calls existing `path_init`, `log_init` and `Device::available_devices`.
Static implementation symbols are private to the shared library: explicit
exports on Windows, linker export lists on ELF/Mach-O. Dependencies may still
be separate runtime libraries; a C ABI does not make them self-contained or
guarantee compatibility between arbitrary dependency versions.

The API and tests are intentionally limited to Phase 1. ABI evolution and render
parity remain acceptance gates in the [plan](../../docs/plans/CYCLES_C_API.md).
